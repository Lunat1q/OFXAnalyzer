# That software allows you to import your OFX file from a bank.

## Features: 
- Support of multi-account OFX file, consolidating all transactions into single list
- Transaction ignore logic, that is helpful to filter out transactions from balance income and expenses
- Transaction grouping with rich settings and multiple matching rules
- Custom colors for groups

## Plans 
- Add more rules
- Add conditional formulas for matching instead of hardcoded rule types.
- Refactor `TransactionAnalysisContext` madness
